# Interface Improvement Proposals

This document outlines several potential strategies to improve the usability and clarity of the automation application's command-line interface.

### 1. Add Descriptions to Menu Items (Easy Win)

The main menu can be made much clearer by adding short, descriptive hints to each option. This reduces the user's cognitive load, as they won't have to remember the exact function of each item.

**Example:**

-   **Current:** `Process scheduled posts for X manually`
-   **Proposed:** `Process scheduled posts for X manually (Run a one-time check for due posts)`

**Implementation:** This can be achieved by modifying the `name` property of the choice objects in the `inquirer` prompt configuration.

### 2. Better Visual Grouping with Separators

The main menu can be reorganized into logical sections using separators. This helps the user parse the options more quickly and find the command they are looking for.

**Proposed Layout:**

```
Current Platform: X. What would you like to do?
  > Post a new cartoon to X immediately
  > Manage Creative Profiles
  ----------- Posting Scheduler -----------
  > Start the scheduler for X
  > Stop the scheduler
  > Process scheduled posts for X manually
  ----------- App Management -----------
  > Switch Platform
  > Reload the configuration file (config.json)
  > Quit
```

**Implementation:** This involves reordering the `choices` array in the main menu's `inquirer` prompt and adding more `new inquirer.Separator()` instances.

### 3. Implement a "Back" Option in Workflows

Currently, once a workflow like "Post immediately" is started, the only way to exit is to complete it or kill the application. A "Go Back" option could be added to the prompts within these workflows to allow the user to gracefully return to the main menu.

**Example:**

```
Choose the framing for the virtual influencer:
  > A medium-shot portrait, framed from the waist up.
  > A close-up shot, focusing on the face and shoulders.
  -----------
  > Go Back to Main Menu
```

**Implementation:** This is a more involved change. It would require adding a "Go Back" option to the relevant `choices` arrays. The function handling the prompt would then need to check for this specific selection and return a special value (e.g., `null` or `'back'`). The main application loop would then interpret this value as a command to break the current workflow and re-display the main menu.

### 4. Display a Dynamic "Breadcrumb" Trail

To prevent the user from getting lost in nested menus, a "breadcrumb" trail can be displayed in every prompt message, showing the user's current location in the menu tree.

**Example Flow:**

1.  **Main Menu:** `Main Menu > What would you like to do?`
2.  **User selects "Manage Creative Profiles"**
3.  **Sub-Menu:** `Main Menu > Manage Creative Profiles > What would you like to do?`
4.  **User selects "Create a New Profile"**
5.  **Final Prompt:** `Main Menu > Manage Creative Profiles > Create > Enter a filename:`

**Implementation:** This involves creating a `breadcrumb` variable in the main loop. This variable would be passed to each function that contains a prompt. The prompt's `message` would be dynamically constructed to include the breadcrumb string, and the string would be appended with the current menu level before being passed to any sub-menu function.
