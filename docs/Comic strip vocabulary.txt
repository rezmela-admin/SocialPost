In comic strips and graphic novels, artists have developed a little toolkit of visual artifacts to convey not just dialogue but mood, narration, sound, and emphasis. Here are the main ones you’re seeing and some others you may find useful:

1. Speech balloons (chat bubbles)

Rounded or oval shapes with tails pointing to the speaker.

Variants: jagged borders (shouting), dotted or faded lines (whispering), rectangular “robotic” ones (electronic voices).

2. Thought balloons

Typically cloud-shaped with a series of small bubbles leading to the thinker’s head.

Used to show internal monologue.

3. Caption boxes

The “simple boxes” you noticed are usually called captions.

They provide narration, scene-setting, or authorial commentary.

Often rectangular, without a tail, and sit at the top or bottom of a panel.

4. Sound effects (onomatopoeia)

Stylized text like BANG!, WHOOSH, ZZZ.

Integrated into the art, often with exaggerated fonts or distortions.

5. Labels and signs

In-world written elements (a street sign, a poster, a note someone is holding).

Sometimes stylized to stand out as part of the storytelling.

6. Symbols above characters

Sweat drops, storm clouds, hearts, stars, spirals.

Especially common in manga, shorthand for emotional states (stress, love, dizziness, anger).

7. Frame breaks and inset panels

A character or object bursting through the panel border, or a small inset “zoom” panel inside a larger one.

Used for emphasis, pacing, or showing simultaneous action.

8. Emphasis lines (action lines, motion streaks, aura effects)

Radiating lines behind a character to show shock, speed streaks behind moving objects, glowing effects for power-ups.

9. Narrative icons / pictograms

Small images instead of words inside balloons, e.g. a skull for “death,” a lightbulb for “idea.”

Often used in humorous or kid-friendly comics.

Each of these serves as a kind of “visual grammar” — speech balloons are like dialogue, captions are like stage directions, sound effects are audio cues, and symbols are emotional shorthand. Comics basically evolved their own typography of information.

Want me to sketch out how these elements might be layered in a single frame so you can see the interplay?
