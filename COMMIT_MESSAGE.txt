refactor(ui, workflow): Implement prerequisite-first menu and enhance creative tooling

This commit introduces a major refactoring of the user interface and content generation workflow, focusing on improved usability, clarity, and backend robustness.

### 1. UI/UX Overhaul
- **Prerequisite-First Menu Flow:** The main menu has been re-architected to guide the user logically through the content creation process. The menu order is now:
    1. Comic Format (panels & layout)
    2. Story Pattern (narrative structure)
    3. Default Platforms
    4. Create New...
  This ensures that foundational choices are made before starting the creative process.

- **Improved Terminology:** Confusing jargon has been replaced with clearer terms throughout the UI.
    - "Creative Profiles" are now **"Comic Format"**.
    - "Narrative Frameworks" are now **"Story Patterns"**.

- **New Asset Browsers:** Two new menu items have been added to allow users to browse creative assets directly:
    - **Graphic Styles Browser:** For previewing available visual styles.
    - **Characters Browser:** For viewing the library of available characters.

- **Refactored Story Pattern Selector:** The old flat-list framework selector has been replaced with a powerful, recursive menu builder that can generate a selection UI from a nested directory structure of Story Patterns.

### 2. Generation Engine Enhancements
- **Automated Dialogue Shortening:** A new utility (`shortenDialogueIfNeeded`) automatically shortens dialogue that exceeds the configured word count (`speechBubbles.maxWords`), improving the visual quality of speech bubbles.
- **More Robust Image Generation:** The retry logic has been enhanced. On generation failure, the user is now presented with options to retry, try a safer re-worded prompt, or edit the prompt manually.
- **Configuration:** Added `maxRetries` and `speechBubbles` settings to `config.json` for finer control over the generation process.

### 3. Content & Creative Assets
- **Expanded Character Library:** Added 15 new public figures and thinkers to `character_library.json`.
- **New "Ink-Sketchbook" Style:** A new high-contrast, black-and-white graphic style has been added.

### Files Changed
- **Refactored:**
    - `src/lib/ui/menu.js` (Reordered and new items added)
    - `src/lib/ui/framework-selector.js` (Rewritten for directory-based menus)
    - `src/lib/profile-manager.js` (Menu labels updated)
    - `src/lib/utils.js` (New dialogue shortening and retry logic)
    - `src/lib/workflows.js` (Integrated new retry and shortening logic)
- **Content Updated:**
    - `character_library.json`
    - `graphic_styles.json`
    - `config.json`
- **Removed:**
    - The legacy, flat-file JSON definitions in `narrative_frameworks/` have been removed in favor of the new directory-based Story Pattern engine.
