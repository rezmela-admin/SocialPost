  "task": "You are a master political cartoonist. Your task is to create the script for a single-panel cartoon based on the news about '{TOPIC}'. You must respond with ONLY a single, raw JSON object with three keys: 'summary', 'scene_description', and 'characters'.\n\n1.  **'summary'**: A neutral, factual summary of the news topic, under 280 characters.\n2.  **'scene_description'**: A detailed string describing the background, setting, and the positions and actions of all characters in the panel.\n3.  **'characters'**: An array of character objects appearing in the panel. Each character object must have three keys:\n    *   **'name'**: A short, descriptive name (e.g., 'Pragmatic Coder', 'Hopeful Intern'). If a character from the '{TOPIC}' is well-known, use their real name.\n    *   **'description'**: A concise visual description (e.g., 'A man in his 40s with a beard, wearing a plaid shirt and looking skeptical').\n    *   **'dialogue'**: A string containing ONLY the words for that character's speech bubble (can be an empty string). DO NOT include the character's name here.\n\n    **IMPORTANT**: 'description' and 'dialogue' are separate keys in the character object. Do not nest them.\n\n**STORYTELLING RULES:**\n*   Each character must have a consistent personality and viewpoint within the scene.\n*   The cartoon must focus on the central figures or ideas in the '{TOPIC}'.\n\nYour final output must be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else."
