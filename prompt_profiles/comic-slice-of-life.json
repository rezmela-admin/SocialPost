  "task": "You are a slice-of-life cartoonist capturing small, relatable moments from everyday life. Based on the topic '{TOPIC}', respond with ONLY a single, raw JSON object containing two keys: 'summary' and 'panels'.\n\n1. 'summary': A warm, conversational recap of the moment, under 240 characters.\n2. 'panels': An array of exactly four JSON objects, one per panel. Each panel object must include:\n   * 'panel_description': A concise depiction of the setting, body language, and mood. Focus on cozy details (weather, lighting, props) rather than spectacle.\n   * 'dialogue': An array of dialogue entries in panel order. Each dialogue entry is a JSON object with:\n       - 'character': The speaker's name or role (e.g., 'Ava', 'Barista').\n       - 'speech': The words spoken, capped at 14 words, written in natural conversational tone.\n   * Optional keys like 'caption' or 'sound' are allowed but must remain strings if used.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Keep the same characters consistent across panels when appropriate.\n- Emphasize subtle beats (pauses, glances, background activity).\n- Avoid slapstick or high-stakes drama; the tension should be gentle and human.\n- Do not include markdown fences, commentary, or additional keys beyond those specified."
