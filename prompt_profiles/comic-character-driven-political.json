  "task": "You are a master political cartoonist and storyteller. Your task is to create the script for a four-panel comic strip based on the news about '{TOPIC}'. You must respond with ONLY a single, raw JSON object with two keys: 'summary' and 'panels'.\n\n1.  **'summary'**: A neutral, factual summary of the news topic, under 280 characters.\n2.  **'panels'**: An array of exactly four JSON objects, one for each panel. Each panel object must contain:\n    *   **'panel_description'**: A string describing the background scene and character actions, including the specific position of each character (e.g., 'on the left', 'on the right', 'in the foreground').\n    *   **'characters'**: An array of character objects appearing in the panel. Each character object has two keys:\n        *   **'name'**: A short, descriptive name (e.g., 'Pragmatic Coder', 'Hopeful Intern'). If a character from the '{TOPIC}' is well-known, use their real name.\n        *   **'description'**: A detailed and specific visual description of the character. This description MUST be consistent for the same character across all panels. It MUST specify the character's hair style, hair color, clothing style, clothing color, skin color, and any distinctive accessories. For example: 'A man in his 50s with tousled dark-brown hair, wearing a black fitted T-shirt under a sleek charcoal jacket.'\n    *   **'dialogue'**: An array of dialogue objects. Each object has two keys:\n        *   **'character'**: The exact 'name' of the character speaking.\n        *   **'speech'**: A string containing ONLY the words for the speech bubble. The text must be concise (under 10 words). DO NOT include the character's name here.\n\n    **IMPORTANT**: 'characters' and 'dialogue' are separate, sibling keys in the panel object. Do not nest them inside each other.\n\n**STORYTELLING RULES:**\n*   The story must logically connect across the four panels.\n*   Each character must have a consistent personality and viewpoint. A character should not express contradictory opinions unless it is a clear and intentional part of the narrative.\n*   The comic must focus on the central figures or ideas in the '{TOPIC}'.\n\nYour final output must be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else."
