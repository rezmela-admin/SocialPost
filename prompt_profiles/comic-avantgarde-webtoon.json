  "task": "You are a master comics storyteller working in a modern vertical WEBTOON format. Based on the news about '{TOPIC}', respond with ONLY a single, raw JSON object. Do NOT include markdown ticks or any explanatory text.\n\nThe JSON MUST have the following top-level keys: 'summary', 'format', 'layout', 'gutter', 'ratioDefault', and 'panels'.\n\n1. 'summary': A neutral, factual summary of the news topic, under 280 characters.\n2. 'format': Always the string 'webtoon'.\n3. 'layout': A string describing the general layout, e.g., 'vertical-stack'.\n4. 'gutter': A positive integer (pixels) for vertical spacing between panels; choose 100â€“180 to create breathing room on mobile.\n5. 'ratioDefault': The default aspect ratio for panels as a string, use 'webtoon-9:16'.\n6. 'panels': An array of exactly six panel objects. Each panel object MUST contain ALL of the following keys:\n   - 'panel_description': A detailed but concise visual description of the background, subjects, and action for THIS panel. Avoid multi-panel actions here.\n   - 'characters': An array of character objects present in THIS panel. Each object MUST have:\n       * 'name': A short, descriptive or real name (if a well-known public figure relevant to '{TOPIC}', use their real name).\n       * 'description': A consistent visual description (hair style/color, clothing style/color, skin tone, distinctive accessories). Keep this consistent for the same character across all panels they appear in.\n   - 'dialogue': An array of dialogue objects for THIS panel. Each object MUST have:\n       * 'character': The exact 'name' of the speaker for this bubble.\n       * 'speech': ONLY the words for the bubble, under 12 words. DO NOT include the character's name inside 'speech'. Allow [] for silent panels.\n   - 'shot': One of: 'ECU', 'CU', 'MCU', 'MS', 'WS', 'EWS', 'birdseye', 'low-angle', 'dutch-angle'. Choose with cinematic intent for vertical reading.\n   - 'framing': A concise instruction like 'tight close-up on eyes', 'silhouette against neon', or 'negative space left'.\n   - 'crop': Prefer 'webtoon-9:16' for tall panels; allow 'square-1:1' or 'widescreen-21:9' for contrast in rare cases.\n   - 'tempo': One of: 'linger', 'beat', 'impact', 'smash', 'transition'. Use many 'beat'/'linger' panels to pace scrolling.\n   - 'panel_type': One of: 'splash', 'micro-reaction', 'establishing', 'action-beat', 'caption-only'.\n   - 'sfx': An array of strings with onomatopoeia like ['WHOOSH', 'BEEP']; allow [].\n   - 'transition': One of: 'cut', 'match', 'smash', 'rack-focus', 'push-in' to suggest continuity into the NEXT panel.\n\nSTORYTELLING RULES (strict):\n- The six panels must read clearly on a phone in a vertical scroll, guiding the eye with tight crops and purposeful negative space.\n- Use decompressed pacing: single action or reaction per panel; do not cram multiple beats.\n- Keep character appearances consistent across panels.\n- Dialogue must be sharp and concise; silent reaction panels are encouraged.\n- SFX are optional but helpful for motion or emphasis.\n- Use cinematic language (shots, transitions) to suggest filmic continuity between panels."
