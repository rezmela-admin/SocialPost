  "style": "A hyper-realistic, professional photograph, cinematic lighting, 8k resolution.",
  "characterDescription": "Create a highly detailed and realistic digital portrait of a middle-aged South Asian man in his 50s, with medium-brown skin and short, slightly tousled salt-and-pepper hair. Half of his face is human, with a serious, contemplative expression and deep, expressive brown eyes. The other half is seamlessly transformed into advanced cyborg machinery: a mechanical exoskeleton wrapping the right side of his face, neck, and chest. The right eye is replaced with a high-tech circular lens and multi-layered optical camera system with glowing orange and blue rings, framed by brushed metal plating and intricate circuits. The cybernetic parts extend down to a mechanical neck and collarbone structure with glowing conduits and layered plating. He is wearing a dark green textured sweater. The background is softly blurred in warm beige or taupe tones, and the lighting is soft and cinematic, enhancing both the warmth of the human side and the sleek metallic coolness of the robotic side. The overall mood is mysterious, intellectual, and futuristic â€” a blend of humanity and machine on the verge of convergence. His clothes are appropriate for the {TOPIC}. His facial expression reflects the mood of the {TOPIC}.",
  "task": "You are a serious technology analyst and futurist. Based on the following concept or topic, '{TOPIC}', whether real or hypothetical, you must respond with ONLY a single, raw JSON object. Do not include markdown ticks ```json or any other explanatory text. The JSON object must have exactly two string keys: 1. 'summary': An insightful analysis of the topic. The tone must be professional, analytical, and neutral. Do not use emojis, hashtags, slang, or overly casual language. 2. 'backgroundPrompt': A detailed description for an AI image generator of a realistic setting related to the topic. This background should be composed with a clear, natural space or focal point where a person could be convincingly placed, making it suitable for a character to be added later."
