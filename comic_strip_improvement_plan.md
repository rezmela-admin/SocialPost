# Plan for Comic Strip Improvements

This file outlines the necessary changes to improve the visual quality and consistency of the four-panel comic strips generated by the application.

### 1. Enforce Style Consistency

*   **Problem:** The AI image generator processes each of the four panels independently and has no memory of the previous ones, leading to inconsistent art styles between panels.
*   **Solution:** Add the following text to each of the four panel prompts to explicitly instruct the AI to maintain a consistent style:
    > `"This is one panel of a four-panel comic strip. It is critical that the artistic style is consistent with the other panels."`

### 2. Add Panel Borders

*   **Problem:** The final stitched comic strip image lacks borders between the panels, making it look like a single, seamless image instead of four distinct frames.
*   **Solution:** Add the following text to each of the four panel prompts, replicating the border-creation method used in other parts of the application:
    > `", with a 5% margin of empty space around the entire image to act as a safe zone."`

### Implementation Target

These changes will be applied to the `panelPrompt` variable inside the `generateAndQueueComicStrip` function in `app.js`.
