  "description": "Grabs attention with a strong claim, teaches a quick idea with three key points, shows the benefit, and encourages engagement with a question.",
  "template": "Structure the post around the 'Hook -> 3 Points -> Payoff -> Question' framework. The Hook is a surprising claim. The 3 Points are crisp, digestible lessons. The Payoff explains what the audience gains by applying the lessons. The Question invites a reply to boost engagement.",
  "example": "Hook: Most productivity hacks fail because they add steps.\n\n3 Points: (1) Reduce friction first: remove one blocker before adding a tool. (2) Shrink scope: make tasks 10 minutes or less. (3) Stack routines: attach new habits to existing ones.\n\nPayoff: You finish more with less effort because the system is hard to abandon.\n\nQuestion: What is one blocker you can remove from your workflow today?"
