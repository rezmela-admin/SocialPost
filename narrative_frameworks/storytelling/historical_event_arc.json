  "example": "Context: In 1848, Paris buzzed with frustration over economic inequality and a rigid monarchy.\n\nSpark: Banquets advocating democratic reform were suddenly banned, angering organizers and citizens alike.\n\nTurning Point: On February 23, protestors clashed with troops; a fatal volley inflamed the city overnight.\n\nOutcome: Louis-Philippe abdicated, and a provisional government proclaimed the Second Republic.\n\nAftermath: Universal male suffrage was introduced, but factional infighting left the republic fragile.\n\nLegacy: The 1848 Revolution showed how quickly pent-up grievances can topple regimes—and how hard it is to build consensus afterward."
