  "description": "Captures a relatable everyday beat with a quiet emotional shift and gentle insight.",
  "template": "Structure the narrative as follows:\n1. Snapshot — set the scene with sensory details that make the moment tangible.\n2. Small Conflict — note the tiny tension, quirk, or contrast unfolding between people or within one character.\n3. Turning Beat — describe the subtle action, gesture, or realization that changes the mood.\n4. Resonance — close with the takeaway feeling, observation, or quiet punchline that lingers.",
  "example": "Snapshot: Saturday morning light filters across a cluttered kitchen table; half-finished crossword, cold coffee.\n\nSmall Conflict: Lea and her dad argue playfully over the final clue—she insists it’s ‘serene’, he’s certain it’s ‘placid’.\n\nTurning Beat: Her little brother wanders in, glances once, and writes ‘quiet’. They stare, then burst out laughing.\n\nResonance: Sometimes the right word is the simplest one, especially when you stop overthinking it."
