  "description": "The pivotal decision, release, or event that changed trajectory.",
  "template": "Structure the post around 'First Breakthrough'. Specify the year and immediate context; the risk taken or obstacle overcome; exactly what was shipped/decided/delivered; one concrete reaction signal (review, chart, award, sales spike, headline, or quote); and the short-term consequence. Keep it specific and dated. For a comic, show the moment of decision contrasted with the first public response (e.g., stage/crowd, newsroom, storefront, or dashboard)."
