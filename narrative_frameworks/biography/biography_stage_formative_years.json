  "description": "Education, mentorship, early projects, and habits that built the craft.",
  "template": "Structure the post around 'Formative Years'. Cover: schools or apprenticeships; mentors and what was learned; first projects or roles (include dates/places if helpful); one early failure and the adjustment it prompted; and a single habit or discipline formed in this period. Tie these details to capabilities that enable later breakthroughs. For a comic, depict a learning environment (studio, lab, workshop) with a small struggle on one side and an incremental win on the other; add date cues.",
  "example": "School: Community college CS (2010–2012); learned C basics and data structures.\n\nMentors: Internship mentor taught code reviews and naming; 'clarity beats cleverness.'\n\nFirst Projects: Campus events app; small wins building CRUD and auth.\n\nEarly Failure: Over‑engineered a side project; missed the deadline.\n\nAdjustment: Switched to small milestones and weekly demos.\n\nHabit: Daily 30‑minute refactor time built an eye for simplicity."
