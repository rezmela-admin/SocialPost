  "description": "Education, mentorship, early projects, and habits that built the craft.",
  "template": "Structure the post around 'Formative Years'. Cover: schools or apprenticeships; mentors and what was learned; first projects or roles (include dates/places if helpful); one early failure and the adjustment it prompted; and a single habit or discipline formed in this period. Tie these details to capabilities that enable later breakthroughs. For a comic, depict a learning environment (studio, lab, workshop) with a small struggle on one side and an incremental win on the other; add date cues."
