  "description": "Pivot to a new direction or second act that regains momentum.",
  "template": "Structure the post around 'Reinvention or Comeback'. Explain the trigger for pivoting; which prior skills were repurposed; what new bets or domains were explored; early skepticism vs. first traction signals; and one clear indicator that the comeback worked (a chart, award, partnership, critical reception). For a comic, show experiments (sketches/whiteboard/iterating) progressing into the first visible sign of traction.",
  "example": "Trigger: Consulting pipeline dried up in 2021; realized teaching had more pull than delivery.\n\nRepurposed Skills: Client onboarding and scoping turned into course structure and worksheets.\n\nNew Bet: Launched a cohort‑based class on API design.\n\nSignals: First 15 sign‑ups from the newsletter; skeptical comments turned into word‑of‑mouth referrals.\n\nIndicator: Partnered with a dev community; sold out 3 cohorts back‑to‑back."
