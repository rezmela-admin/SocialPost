  "description": "Pivot to a new direction or second act that regains momentum.",
  "template": "Structure the post around 'Reinvention or Comeback'. Explain the trigger for pivoting; which prior skills were repurposed; what new bets or domains were explored; early skepticism vs. first traction signals; and one clear indicator that the comeback worked (a chart, award, partnership, critical reception). For a comic, show experiments (sketches/whiteboard/iterating) progressing into the first visible sign of traction."
