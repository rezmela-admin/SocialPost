  "description": "Shift in priorities, mentoring, philanthropy, consolidation of influence.",
  "template": "Structure the post around 'Later Years'. Describe the change in focus (teaching, advising, philanthropy, governance); institutions or initiatives founded; representative routines or rituals; and one humanizing detail that captures daily life. Include date ranges for clarity. For a comic, use a calmer palette and depict 'passing the torch' moments (mentoring, writing, endowments, family)."
