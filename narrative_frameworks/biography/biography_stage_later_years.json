  "name": "Biography Stage: Later Years",
  "description": "Shift in priorities, mentoring, philanthropy, consolidation of influence.",
  "template": "Structure the post around 'Later Years'. Describe the change in focus (teaching, advising, philanthropy, governance); institutions or initiatives founded; representative routines or rituals; and one humanizing detail that captures daily life. Include date ranges for clarity. For a comic, use a calmer palette and depict 'passing the torch' moments (mentoring, writing, endowments, family).",
  "example": "Focus: 2024– — shifted from shipping features to teaching product thinking.\n\nInitiatives: Started a small scholarship for first‑gen coders and a monthly office-hour series.\n\nRituals: Morning walks without headphones; weekly long‑form writing.\n\nHuman detail: Keeps a drawer of thank‑you notes from students and mentees."
