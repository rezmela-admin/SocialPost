  "description": "Childhood context, early constraints, and first sparks that shaped worldview.",
  "template": "Structure the post around 'Early Life & Influences'. Include: birth year and place; family and socioeconomic context; constraints or challenges; first exposure to the domain; one vivid micro-scene (e.g., a classroom moment, a garage tinkering, a library discovery); and a single connecting line explaining how these influences foreshadow later themes. For a comic, use clear era cues (fashion, tech, signage) and a grounded setting (home, school, neighborhood)."
