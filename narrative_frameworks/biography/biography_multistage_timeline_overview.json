  "description": "Summarize the full arc with 4–6 dated nodes that trace the person’s trajectory.",
  "template": "Structure the post as a compact timeline: Origin, First Breakthrough, Rise/Peak, Setback/Reinvention, Later Years, Legacy. Use 4–6 dated nodes with one crisp line each (year, place, what happened, why it mattered). Keep descriptions specific and scannable; avoid fluff. For a comic, arrange visuals as a horizontal or vertical timeline with era cues and small scene icons per node."
