  "description": "What endures today: influence, principles, controversies, and practical takeaways.",
  "template": "Structure the post around 'Legacy and Lessons'. Synthesize what endures (ideas, techniques, institutions, cultural impact); name 2â€“3 specific principles others still apply; briefly acknowledge any unresolved controversies for nuance; and end with a clear, modern takeaway for your audience. Avoid hagiography; be concrete. For a comic, visualize ripple effects: artifacts, successors, timelines, or a 'tools on the table' motif showing what remains in use."
