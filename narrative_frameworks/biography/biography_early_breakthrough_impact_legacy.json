  "name": "Biography: Early Life -> Breakthrough -> Impact -> Legacy",
  "description": "Tells a concise life arc of a well-known figure by anchoring key events to clear stages, with dates, context, and takeaways relevant to today's audience.",
  "template": "Structure the post and visuals around the 'Early Life -> Breakthrough -> Impact -> Legacy' framework. Early Life: 1-2 vivid lines about upbringing, influences, and constraints (include year/place if helpful). Breakthrough: the pivotal decision, event, or release that changed trajectory; specify the year and immediate context. Impact: concrete outcomes after the breakthrough (metrics, awards, adoption, cultural influence). Legacy: what endures today â€” principles, innovations, controversies, or lessons others can apply. If appropriate, acknowledge one setback or controversy for nuance. For a comic, map each stage to a panel with era cues (fashion/tech), captions with dates, and a short quote or contemporary reaction where it adds color."
