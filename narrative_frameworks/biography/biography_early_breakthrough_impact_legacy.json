  "name": "Biography: Early Life -> Breakthrough -> Impact -> Legacy",
  "description": "Tells a concise life arc of a well-known figure by anchoring key events to clear stages, with dates, context, and takeaways relevant to today's audience.",
  "template": "Structure the post and visuals around the 'Early Life -> Breakthrough -> Impact -> Legacy' framework. Early Life: 1-2 vivid lines about upbringing, influences, and constraints (include year/place if helpful). Breakthrough: the pivotal decision, event, or release that changed trajectory; specify the year and immediate context. Impact: concrete outcomes after the breakthrough (metrics, awards, adoption, cultural influence). Legacy: what endures today — principles, innovations, controversies, or lessons others can apply. If appropriate, acknowledge one setback or controversy for nuance. For a comic, map each stage to a panel with era cues (fashion/tech), captions with dates, and a short quote or contemporary reaction where it adds color.",
  "example": "Early Life: 1993, coastal town; borrowed a public library PC to learn HTML after school. Built fan sites on dial‑up and traded tips on forums.\n\nBreakthrough: 2016 — shipped a tiny open‑source CSS utility that solved email layout pain. Dev newsletters picked it up; first 5,000 GitHub stars in 2 months.\n\nImpact: Adopted by indie teams and nonprofits; workshops on accessible markup; small sponsorships funded full‑time maintainer year.\n\nLegacy: Principles that endure — ship small, document well, prioritize accessibility. Takeaway: solve a boring, persistent problem and teach your process so others can build on it."
