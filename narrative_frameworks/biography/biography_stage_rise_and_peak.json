  "name": "Biography Stage: Rise and Peak",
  "description": "Scaling wins, signature style, recognition, and what 'peak' looked like.",
  "template": "Structure the post around 'Rise and Peak'. Highlight 2–3 dated milestones with concrete metrics or markers (audience size, revenue, citations, medals); define their signature approach or style; note key collaborators or teams; and describe what 'peak' practically meant (influence, reach, or mastery). For a comic, use a growth montage (e.g., venues getting larger, product lines expanding, headlines stacking) with era-specific details.",
  "example": "Milestones: 2019 — 10k newsletter subs; 2020 — first conference keynote; 2022 — book launch hits niche bestseller list.\n\nSignature: Clear diagrams + practical checklists, always with a 1‑page summary.\n\nCollaborators: Editor + designer duo sharpened the voice and visuals.\n\nPeak: Practical influence—teams adopted the checklists as standard practice."
