  "template": "Structure the post around 'Rise and Peak'. Highlight 2â€“3 dated milestones with concrete metrics or markers (audience size, revenue, citations, medals); define their signature approach or style; note key collaborators or teams; and describe what 'peak' practically meant (influence, reach, or mastery). For a comic, use a growth montage (e.g., venues getting larger, product lines expanding, headlines stacking) with era-specific details."
