  "template": "Structure the post as a 'Case Study Mini'. The Context describes the subject and their starting point. 'What we did' lists 1-3 precise actions. The Result shows the quantified outcome. 'Replicate' explains how the reader can apply the same principles.",
  "example": "Context: An indie app with 1,200 MAU and 2% trial→paid conversion.\n\nWhat We Did: 1) Added a 3-step onboarding checklist. 2) Swapped the 14‑day trial for 7‑day with a day‑3 nudge. 3) Moved paywall to after first success moment.\n\nResult: Conversion rose to 5.1% in 30 days.\n\nReplicate: Identify your first success moment, place paywall right after it, and send a day‑3 reminder email to inactive trials."
