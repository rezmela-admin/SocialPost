  "name": "Teaching Story: Story -> Principle -> Steps -> Check",
  "description": "Beginner-friendly how-to that turns a short story into a clear principle, actionable steps, and a simple self-check. Works for technical topics, life skills, or lessons learned.",
  "template": "Structure the post around 'Story -> Principle -> Steps -> Check -> CTA'. The Story is a brief, relatable moment that sets context and stakes (1–3 sentences). The Principle is the single rule or insight distilled from the story in plain language (1 sentence). The Steps are a numbered list of 3–7 actions with concrete details (tools, time, example), written in second person; keep each step to one action; include a fallback ('If X happens, then do Y'). The Check gives quick validation: a mini test, expected metric, or small deliverable with a timeframe so readers know it worked. End with a CTA inviting readers to try it today, save/share, or reply with results.",
  "example": "Story: I kept skipping workouts because I felt I needed a full hour. One day I tried a single 10-minute routine and realized consistency mattered more than duration.\n\nPrinciple: Make it so easy you can’t say no.\n\nSteps: 1) Pick one micro-goal (e.g., 10 pushups, 1-page journal, 5 lines of code). 2) Set a 10-minute timer. 3) Do the smallest viable version first; if stuck, switch to an even smaller variant (If it hurts, do wall pushups; if code won’t run, pseudocode on paper). 4) Stop when the timer ends—even if you want more. 5) Log it in a simple tracker (notes app or checkbox).\n\nCheck: You completed the micro-goal 4 of the last 7 days and can point to one tiny artifact (a commit, a note, or a rep count).\n\nCTA: Try your 10-minute session today and reply with what micro-goal you picked."
