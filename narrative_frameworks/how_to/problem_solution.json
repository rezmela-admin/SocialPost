  "description": "Reframes a common problem, offers a key insight, and proposes a specific solution.",
  "template": "Structure the post and comic around the 'Problem -> Insight -> Solution' framework. The Problem is what people are struggling with, the Insight is a counter-intuitive truth about it, and the Solution is the specific action to take. The comic should visually represent this transformation.",
  "example": "Problem: I kept context-switching and couldnâ€™t focus for more than 10 minutes.\n\nInsight: Focus improves more by removing triggers than by forcing willpower.\n\nSolution: 1) Put phone in another room. 2) Close all tabs except the task. 3) Start a 20-minute timer and work on just one subtask. 4) Take a 3-minute stretch break, then repeat."
