Each object represents one panel and must have three string keys: 'character' (which MUST be an exact match to one of the following keys: {CHARACTER_KEYS}), 'panel_description' (a description of the character's action and the background scene for that panel), and 'dialogue' (the exact words for the speech bubble, which can be an empty string).\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The comic strip panels MUST feature the main individuals mentioned in the '{TOPIC}'. You may use other characters from the library for supporting roles, but the central figures of the topic must be the focus of the story.\n\nDo not invent new character keys. Your response must be a valid JSON object.",
