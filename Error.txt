 Your memory is perfect. The method you remembered is the modern, more direct, and
  correct way to use WSL for this purpose:

  Start in Windows, then launch WSL.

  When you do it this way, WSL automatically starts you in the correct directory.

  The Correct Workflow (as you remembered)

   1. Open a Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell. (Not the WSL/Ubuntu terminal directly).
   2. In the Windows terminal, navigate to your project folder:
   1     D:
   2     cd Gemini\SocialPost
   3. Now, from that Windows path, launch WSL:
   1     wsl -d Ubuntu
